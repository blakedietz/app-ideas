# Apps

## Polling application

The one place where you can share all of your ergodox layouts. Vote for your favorite layouts. Create a configurator.

## Audible list

Have an audio interface for reading off a list.

### Use case 

Could use this for grocery shopping without always being on the phone.

Instead of looking through the list you could just use forward and backward track iPhone controls. (e.g. double tap for next item, triple tap for previous item, quadruple tap for removal).

A real time application that tracks your time against a pre-determined route.  See how much time you have to go for the route.  Think outrun style, race against the clock. Set times for a route, compete against the ghost of another racer.

Probably use some sort of machine learning algorithms to identify if a v0 is a transcode.
